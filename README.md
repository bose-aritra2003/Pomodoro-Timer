# Pomodoro Timer
* This is a timer application based on the Pomodoro technique of time management.<br>
* The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.<br>
* It uses a timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks of 5 minutes each.<br>
* Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student.
* After 3 complete pomodoro cycles and one work interval there is a long break of 20 minutes.<br>
* And then the process repeats again.<br>
